# Automate

### [ ] Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document

-   Not yet: You only have read in your data and loaded packages. Once you finish it up don't forget to add it in.

### [ ] The analysis runs without errors

-   Not yet: The analysis is currently not present yet. Don't forget to add it once you are done.

### [ ] The analysis produces the expected output

-   Not yet: The analysis and plotting is currently not present yet. Once you get it up and going don't forget to paste it in and comment it well.


### [ ] Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)

-   Not yet: The cleaning is currently not present yet. Once you finish this I recommend making it its own script and saving the CSVs. Then export the cleaned CSVs into the analysis.

# Organize

### [ ] Raw data is contained in its own folder

-   Meets spec: Her raw data is in her Data folder. She also removed all the other data sets so its just the 4 necessary ones. I need to do this.

### [ ] Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data

-   Not yet: She currently has no intermediate outputs. Once she does I recommend putting them into the outputs folder

### [ ] At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file

-   Meets spec: She has a function in the R folder its called moving_average.R. It is not yet implemented though.

# Document

### [ ] The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs

-   Not yet: She still has to add the output. Once added make sure to show where it is on the read me

### [ ] The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works

-   Not yet: She still needs to add a flow chat. Once you make it you should screen shot it then add it adding pictures is easy to do on readme.

### [ ] The code is appropriately commented

-   Meets spec: The code is appropriately commented. Make sure to keep up the good work as you add more code.

### [ ] Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention

-   Meets spec: The functions and variables make sense and its consistent. Make sure to keep up the descriptive naming as you continue.

# Scale

After cloning the repo on Workbench:

### [ ] Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages

-   Not yet: I recommend you to have a separate R script that will allow another user to download the packages. Have a comment that explains to install the package using that script if they need it.

### [ ] The analysis script runs without errors

-   Not yet: the analysis is currently not made yet. Once made make sure to give it a few tries and make sure to comment
