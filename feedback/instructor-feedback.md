# Exceed Spec

#### At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file
- There are a function moving_average() in `R/moving_average.R`
- I have included Roxygen Comment to give clarity of how the function should work.

#### Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention
- My variables are self-explanatory and should be easily understand to follow along.

# Collaboration
- My participation and contribution to Vedika's project helped her render the `paper.qmd`, which she had issues with `facet_wrap()`. I also asked our TA to find a way to make sure what would be the best way to make the paper more presentable as they included the moving average function in the paper.

[M] **The analysis produces the expected output**

[M] **Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)**

## Organize

[M] Raw data is contained in its own folder

[M] Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data

[E] **At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file**

## Document

[M] The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs

[M] **The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works**

[M] **The code is appropriately commented**

[E] **Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention**

- Great coding style!!

## Scale

After cloning the repo on Workbench:
