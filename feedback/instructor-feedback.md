# Exceed Spec

#### At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file
- There are a function moving_average() in `R/moving_average.R`
- I have included Roxygen Comment to give clarity of how the function should work.

#### Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention
- My variables are self-explanatory and should be easily understand to follow along.

# Collaboration
- My participation and contribution to Vedika's project helped her render the `paper.qmd`, which she had issues with `facet_wrap()`. I also asked our TA to find a way to make sure what would be the best way to make the paper more presentable as they included the moving average function in the paper.
